# NeuroCanvas
Currently using [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) to mask out images.


## TODO
- [ ] Reset button
- [ ] Save button
- [ ] User driven as well
- [ ] Diffusion on the masked stuff.


## Applications
- semantic segmentation labelling
- Re-generating parts of an image
- removing objects from an image

## Notes
We can become better than adobe. If we are better at Image AI stuff.
The UI philosophy is to make python functions for everything. 
No globals just functions and their arguments.
A flask api, streamlit app or gradio prototypes can simply call these functions
accordingly. Having the python library with all the functions is more important. 

## Other ideas
**Meme maker**
Imagine if I could segment anything from one image and paste it inside another image.
Generate meme backgrounds for the segmented out part. lol
